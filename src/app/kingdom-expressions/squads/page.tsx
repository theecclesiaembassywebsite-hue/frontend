                <p>This is an arm of The Ecclesia Embassy committed to demonstrating the Scriptural lifestyle of the Kingdom of God.</p>
                <p>The Bible describes an approved religion, the type accepted as pure and undefiled before God, to be the one committed to meeting the needs of people (James 1:27). Jesus also outlined Ministry to be an avenue of meeting the needs of people with the Gospel in His Mission statement (Luke 4:18). He came to preach the Gospel to the poor, healing to the brokenhearted, deliverance to the captives, recovering of sight to the blind, and to set at liberty them that are bound.</p>
                <p>From the above, it is clear that Ministry involves meeting the needs of people, since all a captive needs is deliverance, and recovery of sight is all the blind needs, and so on.</p>
                <p>Jesus also mentioned that, meeting the needs of people is meeting His own needs, which ultimately improves our relationship with God, and also prepares a place for us in His Kingdom (Matthew 25:31-40).</p>
                <p>It is on the above premise that The Ecclesia Embassy seeks to demonstrate the love of God to the world around us. We use this platform in seizing every opportunity at our disposal, to meet the needs of individuals, communities and organizations around us.</p>
              </div>

              <div>
                <h3 className="font-heading text-xl font-bold text-[#241A42] mb-2">THE APPROACH</h3>
                <p>It is obvious from observations that the needs of people and organizations around us will be cumbersome to be met through one channel. This is the reason for the existence of different Squads within the Kingdom Model Life Squads Initiative.</p>
